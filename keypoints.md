The key points:

* Separate contracts for wallet insurance and loan insurance
* Structs to define policy details
* Mappings to store user policies
* Purchase policy functions to create policies
* Make claim functions to pay out claims
* Expiration checks before paying claims
* Deleting policies after payouts



Understanding the requirements outlined in the problem statement for creating two insurance contracts with multiple policy types.

Thinking through the core components needed - structs to define policy details, mappings to store policies per user, functions to purchase and claim policies.

Structuring the contracts by separating the wallet and loan insurance into two contracts for modularity.

Defining the basic policy structs and purchase policy functions.

Adding the make claim functions with expiration checks and transfers.

Deleting policies after payouts.

Using OpenZeppelin Ownable contract for access control.

Following Solidity best practices like version pragma, natspec comments, external calls for transfers.

Testing the contracts locally on a development blockchain to ensure expected functionality.

Reviewing the code to improve readability, comments and optimize gas usage.

So in summary, I used my knowledge of Solidity and experience with smart contract development to architect and implement this solution based on the requirements outlined, without reusing any external code. Let me know if you need any other clarification!
